const JUAN_TEXT = `
Juan Mesa is a 16-year-old boy with Colombian roots and through his 
artistic journey, he has developed an animated and colorful art style. 
He has tried to make a juvenile style of work. His work focuses on 
animation, doodles, and realism. He uses colors to demonstrate the 
beauty of art. He gained experience in drawing by practicing at home 
and getting self-thought.

He started drawing when his grandfather passed away. He started with a 
drawing dedicated to his grandfather. Then his love for art grew stronger 
each time. He tried to convert a sad situation into the start of an amazing 
artistic future.

He then expanded his vision into not only drawing but creating a brand/business 
combining art and fashion to make it stand out. Now he sells clothes with unique 
designs and motivational quotes hidden in every design. Juan Mesa is the founder
of JM Arts. Juan Mesa is not only a boy with a future, he is a teenager with
talent, vision, and imagination with a level of creativity that is really high. `
